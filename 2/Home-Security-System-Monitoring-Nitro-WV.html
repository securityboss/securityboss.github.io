<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company.

<p>We tried each of the cameras in numerous locations around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was connected to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we tested each camera utilizing an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) in addition to an Android smart device (using a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie).
