<h3>Home Security System Monitoring in North Carolina</h3>
<p>Wireless cameras can be an outstanding option for a video surveillance system. There are a couple of things to consider before choosing a wireless alternative, one being what type is going to be the most beneficial. In this short article I will discuss the various wireless options in addition to the issues that can occur with each.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and often over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reputable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the need for further wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera individually, usually by means of 110VAC power. </p>
