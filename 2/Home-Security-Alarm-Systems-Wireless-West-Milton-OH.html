IP cameras likewise have extra features that analog cameras do not use, such as video analytics, which permit mobile alerts and automatic recording if there is motion within the camera's field of view. This is especially beneficial for times when your business is closed and you wish to know if somebody is moving inside the premises. You can set up the system to flag occasions like this and send out alerts directly to your mobile phone, together with taped video footage of the occasion. Some systems also use a direct, one-touch connection to local law enforcement.</p>
