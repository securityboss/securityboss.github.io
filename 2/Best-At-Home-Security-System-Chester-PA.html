<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect complacency because it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
