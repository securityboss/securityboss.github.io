<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect complacency because it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>

So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notifications and live views were painfully slow, and the range is poor.
