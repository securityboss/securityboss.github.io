<p>As a temptation to buy an alarm, a variety of companies offer "totally free monitoring services" for the first couple of months. Many insurance provider use discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to clients with operable alarm systems. These discounts may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and somewhat less for residential owners. 16 In addition, numerous cops departments provide a number of "totally free" incorrect alarms prior to enforcing any fine, despite the fact that the cost to respond is substantial right from the start. The offers of totally free monitoring services by alarm companies and discount rates from insurers cast doubt on the suitability of the existing pattern in U.S. policing of enabling three or 4 complimentary false alarms per calendar year, due to the fact that they supply no up-front incentives to motivate owners to prevent false alarms.</p>
