<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>

Alexa support is included, as you would get out of an Amazon-owned brand name, and the camera competently manages all the normal functions when it comes to motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is included too, for when the lights head out. </p>
