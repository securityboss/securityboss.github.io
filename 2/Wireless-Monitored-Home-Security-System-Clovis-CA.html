<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of burglar alarms work the exact same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door enables the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
