If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide.

When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to identify those people and will send out mobile phone signals with that details when they appear at your home.
