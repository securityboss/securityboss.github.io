<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients understand that the economical customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
<p>Activity notices alert the user whenever significant activity is found near the camera. Discover if you can get alerts through push alerts, text, and or email. They'll keep you abreast of anything occurring real-time near your camera. You'll also pay more for pro installation through ADT than you would through Vivint, specifically for cameras. And to be honest, we're not awfully impressed by ADT's cameras in the very first place. What you're paying for is primarily that big name in blue. </p>
