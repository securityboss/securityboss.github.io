<p>With an analog system, coaxial cable is needed for transferring video footage from the CCTV security cameras.

We also found the feature to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
