<p>What truly sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be expensive but is necessary. In reality, we don't recommend buying this camera at all unless you plan to include the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera identified activity. Being able to distinguish between an individual and an automobile, for example, allows you to reduce unneeded signals. And Activity Zones are a good perk, especially if you're aiming to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, a doorway, or even garbage cans. </p>
