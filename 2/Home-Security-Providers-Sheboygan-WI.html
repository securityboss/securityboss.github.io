<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
