Its monitoring service includes a benefit called ASAPer, which concurrently messages a group of pre-set contacts to determine whether alarm activity is a real emergency situation or incorrect alarm. Many monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow reaction times.</p>
<p>A system that requires an agreement might be a clever option for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems generally don't featured upfront charges. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the contract. We've seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we suggest contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>
