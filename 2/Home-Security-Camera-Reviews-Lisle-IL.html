Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency given that it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
