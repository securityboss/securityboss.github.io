<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big quantity of information required by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, however not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for additional circuitry.

Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera separately, generally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
