<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send mobile phone notifies with that information when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
