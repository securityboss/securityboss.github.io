<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking to somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly common. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and goes back within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is set off by an area feline, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a property owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the necessary action.</p>
