When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends out dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the danger and, if required, could simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
