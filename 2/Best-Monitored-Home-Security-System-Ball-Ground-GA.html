This generally involves discovering a spot for your camera, creating an account in the app, and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

<p>There's a few other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving objects if it discovers an intruder; a convenient intercom function that allows the device to act as a smart doorbell (although it doesn't have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, given that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.</p>
