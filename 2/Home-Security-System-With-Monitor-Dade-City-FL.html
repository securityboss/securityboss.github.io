The implicit justification for the current push to increase video surveillance is the danger of terrorist attacks. But suicide enemies are clearly not discouraged by video cameras - and might even be drawn in to the tv coverage cameras can make sure - and the cost of an extensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which sucks up around 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice spending plan - far goes beyond the limited benefits that the system might supply in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the fact (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>Include hidden cameras to your business or residence with a GO2 Video Surveillance System.
