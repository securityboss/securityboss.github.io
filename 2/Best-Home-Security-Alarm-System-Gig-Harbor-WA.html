<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the limited series of sensing units. A lot of radio frequencies are weak outside a series of 500 feet.

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the very same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually set up on the patio by a certified electrical expert (who happens to be my husband). All of the cameras were linked to the very same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router inside (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>We have examined many essential reasons why one should consider commercial-grade cameras so far, however, we have actually just skimmed the surface of the subject. In today's network-connected world, a surveillance system is hardly ever a stand-alone system. It is worth knowing if your proposed camera system will integrate with other products. </p>
