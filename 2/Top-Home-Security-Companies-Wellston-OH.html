<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a quick description of how thermal cameras work: All items discharge infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature. The infrared energy given off by an item is called its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it produces. A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of detecting tiny differences in temperature level. The device collects the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and creates an electronic image based on information about the temperature distinctions. Due to the fact that items are rarely precisely the exact same temperature as other items around them, a thermal camera can discover them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>
