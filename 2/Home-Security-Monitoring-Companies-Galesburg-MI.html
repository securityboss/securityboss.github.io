<p>All About Security offers expert, dependable alarm monitoring services for homes and organisations throughout the higher Indianapolis area. The advanced cameras in the market permit two-way audio between people on either side of the video surveillance system. When implemented correctly, two-way audio is a feature with lots of applications - security and non-security. This consists of background music services, delivering help-desk assistance from another location, enhancing loss avoidance, monitoring high-traffic areas, aggression detection, and targeted retail messaging.</p>
<p>The other significant decision when selecting a home security camera is whether you need an indoor or outdoor  camera.

<p>With a condensed periphery and a central focus, a fisheye lens security camera provides you a focused look at a large field of view. It's excellent for a parking lot or a warehouse, where the finer details aren't as crucial as the total photo. These are self-contained and, given that the lens is doing the heavy lifting, they aren't as susceptible to mechanical failure as their multi-lens counterparts.
