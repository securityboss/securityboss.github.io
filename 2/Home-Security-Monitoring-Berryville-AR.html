These devices can be outfitted with anti-tampering innovation to avoid being disarmed.

<p>After evaluating lots of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for many people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both inside and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have a contract, and its equipment pricing is incredibly sensible, so it's not a total splurge.
