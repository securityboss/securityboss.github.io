<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. The smart bit is that the camera not only finds that individuals have actually entered its 130-degree field of view, but it will likewise have a stab at acknowledging them too. Maybe more usefully, if somebody passes who the camera does not know, you get an alert about an "unknown face". You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it should automatically know.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents speaking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, false alarms are relatively typical. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by a neighborhood feline, it can trigger the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the house owner will be contacted by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
