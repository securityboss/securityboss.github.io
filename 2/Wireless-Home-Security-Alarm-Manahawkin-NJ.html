It records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both inside and out, as it's weather resistant.

<p>After we used the Anker EufyCam for nearly 6 months, we're shocked to report that it is on track to provide on its promise of as much as one year of battery life. What we don't love is that it leaves spaces in between recordings, which ranged anywhere from 4 to 34 seconds, depending on the settings. We have actually observed some improvements because the camera's launch, and will continue to check and update this review, as needed.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
