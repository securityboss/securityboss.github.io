<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can determine individuals the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send mobile phone signals with that info when they appear at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random strangers. We also found the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
