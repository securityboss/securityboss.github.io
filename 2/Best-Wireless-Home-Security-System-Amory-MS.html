<p>Absolutely nothing is more crucial than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your household and home. You don't need to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your residential or commercial property and belongings.

As such, if an alarm or sensing unit gets set off while you're away, you have no visual methods of validating if something is really wrong and how serious the scenario is.

The highest picture quality of DVD is only a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
