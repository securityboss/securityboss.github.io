Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, removing the need for more wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
