<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching.

Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion activates.</p>
