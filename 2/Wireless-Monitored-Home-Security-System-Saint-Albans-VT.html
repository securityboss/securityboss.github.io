An owner or burglar alarm company may appeal the evaluation of fees to city hearing examiner, in writing, in way explained in Chapter 20.38 of the Walla Walla Municipal Code, only if the appeal is filed with the AHJ, within fourteen days after the notification is provided to the owner.

For less than $400, you get 2 door and window sensing units, one motion detector, and a video doorbell with two-way talk.</p>
