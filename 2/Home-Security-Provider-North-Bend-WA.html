<h2>Wireless Camera Installation In North Bend</h2>
<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you wish to get out of the contract you need to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I was in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Truly annoying. Once again the sales individuals, or at least mine, do not discuss the 3 year commitment. I called their customer support group and they acknowledged that the sales people do not have to discuss it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the swelling amount, since apparently they auto renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a composed not by mail.  ADT is a nightmare, way too expensive, and not fantastic.</p>
