<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously outstanding piece of technology. For beginners, it looks lovely: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely similar to the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). When you envision a home security camera, it's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you might call to mind. The first wireless function to think about is the security system and its elements, and how they all connect. In the past, every monitoring element was hard-wired back to a panel box. This implied every windows and door needed its own wire and path of holes through your house.</p>

When a zone has been broken, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transmits the message through a telephone line. Once the signal is received, the intruder alarm system will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
