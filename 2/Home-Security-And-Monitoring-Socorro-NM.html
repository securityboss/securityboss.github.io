<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it records a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone notices and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is poor. Likewise, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
