<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we might point them at the same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had installed on the patio by a licensed electrical expert (who takes place to be my spouse).

<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine people the camera is finding using face recognition.

We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
