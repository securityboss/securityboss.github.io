<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>When your camera are installed, you can select whether or not your cameras will be monitored by the central station.

Nevertheless, you may choose to NOT have your cameras monitored by the Central Station (this is generally provided for cameras that are monitoring indoor, suburbs). Cameras that are not monitored by the main station can not be accessed our operators for any reason, even if asked for by the consumer. </p>
