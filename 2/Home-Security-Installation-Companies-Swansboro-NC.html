<h3>Best Home Security Alarm in North Carolina</h3>
<p>When the alarm is tripped, an on-site ringer will generally activate a bell or siren connected to the structure.

<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and often over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that normally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are dependable, however not compatible with IP cameras. In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for more electrical wiring.

Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera independently, generally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
