<p>The Hive View delivers fantastic 1080p images day and night, however the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the most affordable sensitivity setting.

<p>I discussed that all we would need to do is use any one of the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, which camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends double informs: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if required, might merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
