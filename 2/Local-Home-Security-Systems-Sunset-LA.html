There's a lot of speak about wireless cameras, but that term can be confusing. Some makers call a camera wireless" due to the fact that it utilizes a Wi-Fi connection, and others refer to cameras that don't need to be plugged into an outlet.</p>
<h2>Video Surveillance Storage (VSS) Solutions Sunset</h2>
