The first home alarm system was patented in 1853 by a Bostonian developer named Augustus Russell Pope.</p>
<p>In addition to the system itself, security alarms are often paired with a monitoring service. In the event of an alarm, the facilities control unit contacts a main monitoring station. Operators at the station see the signal and take appropriate action, such as getting in touch with property owners, informing police, or dispatching personal security forces. Such signals might be transmitted by means of devoted alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the internet.</p>
