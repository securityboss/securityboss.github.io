<p>However, in any situation where standard-definition video cameras are used, the quality is going to be poor because the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in most of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is measured in TV lines but the results are the exact same); they normally catch horizontal and vertical fields of lines and mix them together to make a single frame; the optimum frame rate is typically 30 frames per second.</p>
<p>In addition to the system itself, security alarms are typically combined with a monitoring service. In case of an alarm, the facilities control system contacts a central monitoring station. Operators at the station see the signal and take suitable action, such as contacting property owners, alerting police, or dispatching private security forces. Such signals may be transmitted via devoted alarm circuits, telephone lines, or the web.</p>
<p>We liked Alder for their quick response times and general flexibility. And managing our system with their touchscreen panel was pretty darn and effortless streamlined. Otherwise, this company offers a similar feature-set as brand names like Frontpoint and Brinks. With the quality of the equipment that is offered today, it's safe to say that the wireless systems are simply as good, if not much better, than the wired systems. Provided all of the other benefits, it's easy to see why so many people are selecting this option. </p>
