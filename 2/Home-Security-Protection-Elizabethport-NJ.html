<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it supplies protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect complacency because it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
