Though Vivint's sensing units are wireless, the control board does need to be installed by a expert and connected  to a source of power.

Our tester stated the service technician provided strong client service: He dropped a couple of unnecessary window sensing units from my expense after deciding that the motion detector was sufficient for the whole front half of my home."
