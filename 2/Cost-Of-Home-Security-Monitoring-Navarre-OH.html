<p>I discussed that all we would require to do is use any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which also consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends out double signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the risk and, if needed, might just push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular flooring.</p>
