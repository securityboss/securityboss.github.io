<p>It depends upon the size and design of the home and the monitoring goals. The advantages of cameras are that you can get visual verification of any activity occurring inside or outside the home.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the large amount of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really quick speeds, and frequently over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reputable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will likewise power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for more circuitry.

Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
