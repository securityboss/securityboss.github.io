<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large amount of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at very fast speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are dependable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the requirement for additional wiring.

Wireless security cameras may require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera individually, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
