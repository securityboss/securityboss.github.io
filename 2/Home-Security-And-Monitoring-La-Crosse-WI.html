Reliability has actually long been at the heart of the argument over wireless versus hardwired home security systems. It's an argument that's often skewed by aspects such as skepticism over the vulnerability of wireless systems, including interference from radio signals and problems that cause false alarms. While improvements in the last few years have actually made the innovation more popular and robust (some systems today have their own unique wireless innovation, which can't be disrupted by other signals), issues persist over vulnerabilities that do not impact hardwired systems.</p>
