The first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German researchers to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually developed into the extremely advanced yet budget-friendly systems available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the methods to tape-record video and watch it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is a deliberate practice to improve the result of security systems.</p>
<p>IP security cameras record analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection. The captured digital video stream is then broadcast over a local area network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which records each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation. The system can be established to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
