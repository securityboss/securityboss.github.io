When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We also discovered the feature to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION).
