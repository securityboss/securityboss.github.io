<p>Remember that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.)

<p>The Canary Flex features an intelligent variation that sends signals straight to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera offers a wide range of functions consisting of a 360-degree swiveling base. Last time I examined a Swann camera I described it as distinctly middle of the roadway.
