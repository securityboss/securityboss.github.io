<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has clearly tried to offer it an attractive edge, and we need to offer credit to its ability to reveal what's going on from up to 4 cameras at a time.

The previous, less expensive version of the outdoor Nest webcam is still on sale too if you want to conserve some money - it does have a cable connected however, rather than working wirelessly, which implies it's a bit simpler to screw up for prospective trespassers.
