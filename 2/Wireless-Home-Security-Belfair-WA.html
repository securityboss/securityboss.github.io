<p>A veteran in the industry with 60 years in the home security business, Link Interactive has gathered an excellent reputation with customers evidenced by its A+ rating on BBB and favorable reviews on websites such as Yelp. The chief positives Link Interactive brings to the table are the wealth of security alternatives offered for different property owner needs and flexible rate points.

The versatility reaches the contracts, too: clients have the alternative of choosing between 1,2, and 3-year agreements, or having no agreement at all.

<p>However monitored systems also tend to have a service agreement, which locks you into paying an often-pricey month-to-month charge for a set quantity of time, normally one to five years. No-contract systems, which allow you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than dedicating to a long-term plan, are ending up being more typical. These systems sometimes cost more in advance for the hardware than pro systems that provide a discount in exchange for that lengthy service agreement. Paying for the equipment in advance offers you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you use the service. And you can stop the monitoring and begin service as often times as you desire.</p>
