Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not suggest it considering that its battery-saving regimens can interrupt efficiency.</p>

If there are no as-built documents supplying performance and configuration information to make this combination work, there are only 2 alternatives. The first alternative, which might be the most complex, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the initial service provider is reluctant or unavailable to provide those information) and document the geography and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system.
