<p>A system that requires a contract might be a smart choice for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems normally don't included upfront costs. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the agreement. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way as much as 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>

This suggests that consumers have plenty to pick from.</p>
<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>

This additional cost isn't perfect, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- particular minimum prices per month for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a steal. </p>
