<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

The customer support reps may even suggest reselling as an option to giving you a refund.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is probably one of the best wireless security systems available today. Although the price might drive some away, the pros far exceed the cons, particularly with the ability to record 2K HDR video, along with an integrated spotlight and "color" night vision. Plus, the Pro 3 includes a free Arlo Smart trial, which adds even more abilities to this remarkable security camera system.</p>
