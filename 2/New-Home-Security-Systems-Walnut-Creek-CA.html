<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk with an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is absolutely something to be taken into account.

A wireless bridge is an excellent alternative for long range circumstances where poles and trees are not present.</p>
