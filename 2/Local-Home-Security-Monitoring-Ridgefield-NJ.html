With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. Incorrect alarms happen.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching.

Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
