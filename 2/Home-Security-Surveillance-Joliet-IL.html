<p>Since the glass real estate does not get in the way, they aren't rather as vandal-proof as dome cameras, however they make up for it in capabilities. As well as being excellent for re-positioning on the fly, they are much better for infrared and low-light since the glass housing does not restrain the lens. With some, it's hard to tell at a glance where they've been intended, so they can give a panoptic impression as a deterrent, regardless of their real field of view.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only a false sense of security considering that it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
