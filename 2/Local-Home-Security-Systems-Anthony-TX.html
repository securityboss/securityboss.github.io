<p>There are also wireless IP cameras offered that need little more than installing, but those might be less secure than wired connections. If you choose wireless, you'll need to make sure the signal can't be quickly obstructed. Once again, it all comes back to your particular needs and the type of system you're trying to construct.</p>

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are almost identical to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's plans are somewhat more expensive for the exact same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are burdensome, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>
<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see in the evening. If catching video footage in the dark is a top priority, ensure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
