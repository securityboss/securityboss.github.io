<p>Seattle's primary intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more responsible for incorrect alarms, and reduce the number of unnecessary cops and fire reactions. Alarm monitoring companies are the experts and need to be teaching their consumers how to properly set and care for their alarm.
