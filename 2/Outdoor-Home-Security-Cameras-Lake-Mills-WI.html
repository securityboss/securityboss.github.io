<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to find it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency given that it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
