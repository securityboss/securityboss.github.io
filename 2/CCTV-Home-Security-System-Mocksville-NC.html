<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
<p>We tried each of the cameras in numerous places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet away from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service. When possible, we checked each camera utilizing an iOS gadget (an iPhone 7 and an iPad) as well as an Android mobile phone (utilizing a Nokia 3.1 running Android 9 Pie). Although FrontPoint uses a variety of equipment and home automation products at an affordable rate, the one area where the company especially stands out is in Do It Yourself installation. </p>
