<p>When choosing a home security camera is whether you require an indoor or outdoor  camera, the other major choice. Outdoor cameras will frequently be constructed to be more able and durable to endure rain, frost, or damp.

<p>Carbon monoxide detection. Carbon monoxide (CO) is a gas that can be harmful to both humans and animals.

Thankfully, most wireless security systems consist of carbon monoxide gas alarms that sound off if the amount of CO in your house rises to a hazardous level.
