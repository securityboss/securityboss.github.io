Due to the fact that ADT has more consumers than many brand names-- which implies it has more chances to run into problems, part of that is. But part of it is the method ADT offers its equipment. When a company works with several dealerships and suppliers, its customers are going to get a broad range of experiences. Some will be good, and some will be bad.</p>
