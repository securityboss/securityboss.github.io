Sure, you get a lower cost if you opt for a three-year agreement, however considering that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining contract if you cancel, it's a big dedication. So pick what will be the better deal for you. Go with the contract and enjoy those savings if you know you'll remain put for at least 3 years.
