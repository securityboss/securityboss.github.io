So I still have 21 months of an agreement I had no concept I remained in, to go out I need to pay $783.  Really frustrating. Again the sales people, or at least mine, do not mention the 3 year dedication. I called their customer care team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to discuss it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, because obviously they automobile renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a composed not by mail.
