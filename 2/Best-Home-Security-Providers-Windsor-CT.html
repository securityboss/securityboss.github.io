<p>Security: There have been lots of headlines about hackers jeopardizing home cameras, infant screens, and other Wi-Fi devices to spy on people, so make certain to check what steps has each maker taken to remove this issue. Try to find a camera that supports current wireless security protocols, such as WPA2, and make certain it encrypts internet transmission of your user name, your password, and the live feeds.

The highest picture quality of DVD is just a little lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
