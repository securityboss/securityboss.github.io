<p>But monitored systems also tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly fee for a set quantity of time, usually one to five years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-term plan, are becoming more typical. These systems sometimes cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that provide a discount rate in exchange for that lengthy service agreement. Paying for the equipment up front provides you with a lot of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can stop the monitoring and begin service as many times as you desire.</p>
