<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times more likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and runs its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service consists of an advantage called ASAPer, which at the same time messages a group of pre-set contacts to identify whether alarm activity is a real emergency situation or incorrect alarm.

<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our screening-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a large, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We need to keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based on available bandwidth, which might vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that might beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
