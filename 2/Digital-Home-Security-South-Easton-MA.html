<p>Numerous full-time" homeowners with alarm tell us that they are home all the time" and question why they would require monitoring.

Who will hear and react to the alarm? And so on. If that system is not monitored, less than half the protection the consumer expects is being provided.</p>
<p>The combination of digital video surveillance and access control is part of the natural convergence of security innovations.
