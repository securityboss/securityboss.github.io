<h2>CCTV Systems For Business El Mirage</h2>
<p>In the past, a surveillance security system usually consisted of several cameras linked-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which recorded the images and displayed them on a closed circuit television (CCTV) or monitor. Nowadays, it's much easier to have a standalone security camera. Whether you have one camera or a number of, they work with your home's web network to send out video right to your computer or mobile phone.
