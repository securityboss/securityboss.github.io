<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  , if you want to get out of the contract you have to pay 75% of the agreement.. So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I was in, to go out I have to pay $783.  Actually frustrating. Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not discuss the 3 year commitment. I called their client service group and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the small print. I'm paying the lump amount, because obviously they car renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of having to send in a composed not by mail.

<p>The cover of darkness isn't sufficient to keep this late night lurker's identity hidden from Arlo's view. The one time where lag does end up being a bit of a problem is in between taping and spotting movement.

They could get past the camera before it had time to tape them if a nefarious lawbreaker was quick enough.</p>
