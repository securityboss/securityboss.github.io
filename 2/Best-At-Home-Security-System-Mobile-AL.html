<p>There's a couple of other cool features in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving objects if it identifies an intruder; a handy intercom function that enables the gadget to function as a smart doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, since Alphabet owns Nest, the camera carries Google Assistant.</p>
