<p>However, in any situation where standard-definition camera are used, the quality is going to be poor due to the fact that the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in the majority of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is determined in TV lines but the results are the exact same); they generally record horizontal and vertical fields of lines and mix them together to make a single frame; the optimum frame rate is typically 30 frames per second.</p>
