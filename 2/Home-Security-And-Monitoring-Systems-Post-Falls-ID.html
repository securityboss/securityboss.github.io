<p>However, in any situation where standard-definition camera are used, the quality is going to be poor due to the fact that the maximum pixel resolution of the image chips in the majority of these devices is 320,000 pixels (analogue quality is determined in TV lines but the results are the exact same); they generally record horizontal and vertical fields of lines and mix them together to make a single frame; the optimum frame rate is typically 30 frames per second.</p>

We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
