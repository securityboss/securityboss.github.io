<p>The rate of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, due to the fact that it consists of three outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month subscription cost sounds pricey, however it's not so much when you consider that a live human being is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras spot suspicious activity. That person at Deep Sentinel's center can caution a suspicious person that they're being observed, and they can call your local cops dispatcher if they refuse to leave or engage in a criminal act.

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
