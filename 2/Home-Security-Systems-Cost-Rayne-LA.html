<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to discover it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect sense of security because it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
