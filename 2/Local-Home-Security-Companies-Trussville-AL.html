Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect complacency considering that it avoids just "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
