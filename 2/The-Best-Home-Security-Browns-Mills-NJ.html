<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally normal since the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
