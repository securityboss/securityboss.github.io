When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those individuals and will send out smart device informs with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
