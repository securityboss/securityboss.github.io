<p>We have all heard that old stating, you get what you pay for". According to a report released by the Urban Institute, cops departments across the country respond to millions of false alarms from person and business security systems every year. This costs cities and towns countless dollars in wasted police resources. The Vivint Smart Home security system is reputable and simple to utilize, however expensive and eccentric unless you want the benefit of a professional install and upkeep.</p>
<p>The most significant downside of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensor gets triggered while you're away, you have no visual means of confirming if something is actually incorrect and how serious the scenario is. If the alarm occurrence is determined to be an incorrect alarm, the city will mail a billing summarizing the event and evaluating a cost, if any.</p>

<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency.

For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is an excellent choice for long variety circumstances where poles and trees are not present.</p>
<p>Many self monitored alarm permit you to include a number of different members or devices into the system so they can all monitor your home together.
