False alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the authorities if they occur frequently enough.

Nevertheless, with an unmonitored system, it's up to you to get in touch with the police or other emergency services if your home is in danger. Still, the unmonitored system is much less expensive and for that reason is still the much better alternative for many who are just concerned about cost. </p>
