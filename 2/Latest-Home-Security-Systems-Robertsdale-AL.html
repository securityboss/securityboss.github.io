<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If capturing footage in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>
