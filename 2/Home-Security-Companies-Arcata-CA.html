<p>What truly sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be expensive but is essential. In reality, we do not advise buying this camera at all unless you plan to include the subscription. Without it, you won't get the person-detection feature, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, an in-depth, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity. Being able to compare a person and a car, for example, enables you to cut down on unneeded signals. And Activity Zones are a great perk, particularly if you're aiming to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, a doorway, and even garbage cans. </p>
