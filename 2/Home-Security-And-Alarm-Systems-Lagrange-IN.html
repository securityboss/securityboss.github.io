In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the need for additional circuitry. When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera independently, typically via 110VAC power. </p>
