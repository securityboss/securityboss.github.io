<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the same area and expose them all to the very same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the deck by a licensed electrical expert (who occurs to be my husband). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network through a Wi-Fi router indoors (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, but it implies you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the unit will reply. It likewise suggests that if you actually saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could quickly tape-record a message to him or her through your mobile phone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you think of, would suffice to send out even the most committed profession criminal scampering empty-handed down the roadway. </p>
