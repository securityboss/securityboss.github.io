<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered a data breach, however we concur with its recommendation that users should reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive measure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such incidents.

If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we do not think that these concerns modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay positive in our existing recommendation.</p>
