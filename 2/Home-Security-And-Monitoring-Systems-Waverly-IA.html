<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had set up on the porch by a licensed electrical expert (who occurs to be my spouse). All of the cameras were connected to the same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router indoors (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
