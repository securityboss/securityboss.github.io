<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it offers protection only when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect sense of security given that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
