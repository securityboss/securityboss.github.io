<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more expensive for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation charges are difficult, and its pricing is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyhow.</p>
<p>Wired systems offer permanence and higher dependability, while wireless systems provide a high level of personalization and the ease of movement.
