<h2>Outdoor Wireless Security Camera Clarkston</h2>
<p>This is the best-scoring smart alarm we tested. It was extremely basic to establish, as the elements are pre-paired to the base station, and it was quick to activate when any of the sensors were activated. We love that it includes both external and internal sirens and will even work with Philips Hue smart lights, too. The instructions are incredibly thorough and the 200m range of the alarm indicates it can be used to safeguard garages and sheds in addition to your home. The alarm system does not include a wifi security camera however you can purchase a variety of different Yale cameras that will work with the alarm as optional bonus. There's no external monitoring option with this alarm.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, this alarm system is a starter kit". So it's pretty much anticipated that it will not have extended customizability or a vast array of features. However, I am still dissatisfied that they have not included a minimum of a basic camera with this kit. Cameras are pretty basic for self monitored alarm systems, especially because false alarms is a very genuine possibility.</p>
