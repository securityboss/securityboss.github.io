There are a handful of companies that offer free video storage, but the video is sent out to a cloud account and just kept for a couple of days. For longer access to video, expect to pay a regular monthly storage fee.</p>

<p>The very first thing I look at in a security system are its system components. Home security industry is trying to provide new devices and technology is developing. Now, many security systems involve a great number of components, such as a base station, security camera, glass, entry, and motion break sensing units, a keypad, and crucial fobs, among other parts. But I also appreciate minimalist systems that parts that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some elements can make home automation available to you. Whatever the components are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensing unit, smart lock, etc.), I wish to ensure that they all quickly communicate with your app that is always at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>

What you usually discover at stores are consumer-grade cameras, which typically come 8 or 16 cameras bundled with a video recorder and sell for less than a thousand dollars (United States $) for the set. The second classification of camera, commercial-grade cameras, typically starts at about $400 (United States) per camera-- a significantly higher price. The video recorder should be acquired individually, and commercial grade recorders begin at about $500 (US $) and can range as much as $5000 depending on the amount of storage, camera connection, and image processing functions.</p>
