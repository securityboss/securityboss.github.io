<p>Basically, security doorbells are just small security cameras - wired or wireless - that consist of a door buzzer and a 2-way intercom in the frame. Integrating the benefits of a security camera and an intercom offers you a wide variety of effective features to secure your home or business. The videos your camera records probably will not be saved on the camera itself.

<p>So why don't we rank ADT higher? In some ways, ADT annoys us. We see so many growing companies branching out and trying new things in the home security area. However ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its rates isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to mention that the client service experience differs extensively depending on the dealership you go with. </p>
