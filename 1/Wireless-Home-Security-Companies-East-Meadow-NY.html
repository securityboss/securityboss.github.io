<h3>Wireless Security Alarm in East Meadow NY</h3>

In 2007, I contracted with ADT to install a home security system and regular monthly theft and fire monitoring. The overall installation charge alone was not cheap-- numerous thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Another factor to think about is security, a wireless connection is rather easy for hackers to gain access to. If a hacker were to get to your wireless network they would likewise have access to the security cameras and the data being recorded.  There are gadgets called wifi jammers that trigger the signal to jam rendering the camera worthless for tape-recording that activity.</p>
<p>Numerous video systems are simply recorders. KastleVideo is wise. Now, through advances in analytics, you can set rules for what you care about many.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no special equipment or software application to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security given that it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>

<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company. When the system discovers a break-in, fire, or other emergency situation, it alerts the security team and, in some cases, emergency situation responders.
