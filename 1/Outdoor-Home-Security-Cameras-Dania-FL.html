Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
