<p>Do burglar alarms represent break-in decreases in the United States? The U.S. robbery rate has declined progressively and considerably since the early 1980s. 13 Throughout the exact same time, the variety of properties with alarms increased, however there is no evidence of a link between the two. During the 1990s through 2004, when alarm ownership experienced a steep rise, other types of criminal offense declined just as dramatically as break-in, suggesting that factors aside from a boost in the number of alarm systems sustained the burglary decrease.</p>
<p>In addition, IP cameras work with network video recorders (NVRs), which offer a number of other advantages over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover. In other words, NVR records higher-quality video and enables systems to be scaled up much more easily than can be finished with DVR.
