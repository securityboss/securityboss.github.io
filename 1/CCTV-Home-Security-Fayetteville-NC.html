All smart-home devices are susceptible to such incidents. Nevertheless, after this latest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have chosen to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our wise video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we don't think that these issues modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our present suggestion.</p>
