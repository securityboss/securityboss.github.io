<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send out smart device informs with that info when they appear at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
