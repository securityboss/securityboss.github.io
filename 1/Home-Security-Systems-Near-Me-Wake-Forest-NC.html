In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cable televisions will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for more wiring. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras might need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera independently, typically through 110VAC power. </p>
