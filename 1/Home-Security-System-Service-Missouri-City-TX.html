On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of wise home equipment for flexibility and low prices.

The app is extremely excellent, and while the level of control does not match SmartThings, creating 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you trip the motion sensing unit in the early morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>
