<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to capture clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. If recording footage in the dark is a concern, make sure your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
<p>Some Ring users have reported security breaches in their devices that allow bad stars to use the two-way communication and see the video feed. In a declaration to SafeWise, Ring noted that these breaches can be avoided by using strong, distinct passwords, allowing two-factor authentication, altering passwords regularly, and including authorized users rather of sharing credentials. </p>
