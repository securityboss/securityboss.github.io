<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; two- and four-legged alike. We first discovered Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E Once we tried it out, it quickly became a staff (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a noise maker.

<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
