<p>We do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complex than it needs to be. Recordings, notifies, and integration all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
