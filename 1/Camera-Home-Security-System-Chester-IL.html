<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive strategy, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and functions are nearly similar to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are a little more expensive for the exact same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are burdensome, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer recommend anyhow.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most highly advanced outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even identify individuals you've labeled (after a learning duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
