<p>While every homeowner worries about break-ins, suspicion has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high costs, complex contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces often leading to false alarms. Innovation integration is one Vivint's strong points. The company's remarkable mobile app has actually been highly rated by users on both Google Play and the App Store. It allows customers to inspect live video feed, shut off and trigger security systems, and manage their automated home systems including wise locks, the Philips Hue system, and Nest and Element thermostats. Smart systems can connect to Google Home and Amazon Echo, for a smoother automation experience.</p>

A fine example is the Vivint system, which we have actually evaluated individually and do not recommend for most people.</p>
