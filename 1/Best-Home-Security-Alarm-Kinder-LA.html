<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically more secure, however after reading this post, it will sure make you feel virtually susceptible. The other notable aspects of the Pro 2 are that unlike the Q Plus (the other Arlo design which I'm going to discuss in just a 2nd), it is designed for outdoor in addition to indoor usage, so it'll work come rain or shine. It also has a USB slot so you can record your video straight onto there, which conserves you having to handle the cloud storage system described above.</p>

For my money, systems like these deal some of the best value for your home security dollar.</p>
