<p>Absolutely nothing is more crucial than securing what you treasure most ... your family and home. The implicit justification for the recent push to increase video surveillance is the threat of terrorist attacks. However suicide enemies are plainly not discouraged by camera - and might even be brought in to the television coverage cameras can guarantee - and the expenditure of a substantial video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up roughly 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice budget plan - far goes beyond the limited benefits that the system may provide in examining attacks or attempted attacks after the fact (see reality sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
<p>We didn't consider alarm that required professional installation. Pro-installed systems usually cost more, use equipment comparable to that of DIY systems, included usually burdensome and long agreements, and often depend on the very same monitoring companies that self-installed systems utilize, so they offer little benefit. A good example is the Vivint system, which we've reviewed separately and don't advise for most people.</p>
