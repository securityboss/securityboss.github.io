<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
<p>The majority of the self-monitored starter packages do not consist of outdoor cameras. Outdoor cameras are a little harder to install considering that they have to be mounted to a home.

<p>SimpliSafe, on the other hand, tends to cost between $200 and $500 for initial equipment purchase. That's because it does not use the rent-to-own design that's popular with many security brands. If it does not meet your requirements, you're complimentary to resell your SimpliSafe equipment on Amazon or eBay. The customer care representatives may even recommend reselling as an alternative to providing you a refund.</p>
<p>As you weigh your security options, make certain you're not disregarding the security fundamentals. Why bother getting that expensive alarm if you consistently leave the front door unlocked and have such dim lighting that a camera can't tape a clear image anyhow? Invest in good door locks and window locks, and make sure crucial locations like entrances and the cash register are well-lit.</p>
