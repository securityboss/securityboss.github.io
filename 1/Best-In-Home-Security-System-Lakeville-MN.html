<p>What truly sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be pricey but is essential.

Being able to distinguish between a person and an automobile, for instance, enables you to cut down on unneeded signals. And Activity Zones are a great perk, particularly if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the lawn, a doorway, and even garbage cans. </p>
