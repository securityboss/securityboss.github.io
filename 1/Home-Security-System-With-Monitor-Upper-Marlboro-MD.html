<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near to the NVR is absolutely something to be taken into consideration. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal.

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false sense of security considering that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
