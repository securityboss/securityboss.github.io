<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk to an existing network must be within 300 feet for optimum performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is certainly something to be considered. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal.

Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, clever lock, and so on), I want to ensure that they all quickly communicate with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can keep an eye on them from afar.</p>
