<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually plainly attempted to give it an attractive edge, and we have to give credit to its ability to reveal what's going on from approximately 4 cameras at a time.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as most CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and frequently over long distances.

When the security cameras are not linked to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and requires a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may require less circuitry in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera separately, typically by means of 110VAC power. </p>
