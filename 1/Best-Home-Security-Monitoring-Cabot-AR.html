(You can secure that plug and add another 15 feet of cable with the $30 extension kit, or acquire a Window Mount or a Plug Mount) This indicates the Circle 2 winds up being more pricey overall per unit than the Nest camera if you want a weatherproof option. Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not recommend it because its battery-saving regimens can disrupt performance.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
