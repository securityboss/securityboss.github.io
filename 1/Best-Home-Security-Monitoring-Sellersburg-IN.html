The equipment required for the wired system tends to be a bit more affordable than the wireless systems.

<p>After testing dozens of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for many people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tapes high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is totally wireless, and can be established both inside your home and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have a contract, and its equipment pricing is super sensible, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
