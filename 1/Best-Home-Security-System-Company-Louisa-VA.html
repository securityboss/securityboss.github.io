<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for ideal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near the NVR is certainly something to be considered. For instance if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a fantastic alternative for long range situations where trees and poles are not present.</p>

We first discovered Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly became a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.
