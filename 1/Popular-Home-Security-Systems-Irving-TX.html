The creative bit is that the camera not only finds that individuals have actually entered its 130-degree field of view, however it will also have a stab at recognising them too. Maybe more usefully, if somebody passes who the camera doesn't know, you get an alert about an "unidentified face".

<p>You can trigger the 80dB alarm if you do come across a home invasion emergency situation. I am a little disappointed by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas lots of other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm needs to suffice to frighten trespassers in many cases. To recover costs and hold alarm companies liable for false alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company need to be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and supply physical proof like camera video footage or a broken window to require cops reaction.</p>
