When a user turns on a computer system and it latches on to a wireless access point from a neighboring company's overlapping network, the user might not even understand that this has happened. Nevertheless, it is a security breach in that proprietary company information is exposed and now there could exist a link from one company to the other.

<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered an information breach, but we agree with its suggestion that users should reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a precautionary procedure. All smart-home gadgets are vulnerable to such occurrences.

If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? section from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we don't think that these problems alter the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our current suggestion.</p>
