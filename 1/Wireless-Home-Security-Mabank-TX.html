The Vivint Smart Home security system is simple and trustworthy to use, however expensive and quirky unless you desire the convenience of a professional install and maintenance.</p>

And if you wish to save 4K videos, it's an additional $1.99 per camera per month, on top of the monthly strategy, the latter of which is waived for the very first year.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
