<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify individuals the camera is finding using face recognition.

After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send smart device notifies with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
