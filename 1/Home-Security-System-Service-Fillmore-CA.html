<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is premium, if not particularly cutting-edge, so we're really suggesting the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan alternative. Sure, you get a lower rate if you choose a three-year agreement, but since Nest needs you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a huge commitment. So choose what will be the much better offer for you. Go with the contract and gain those savings if you understand you'll stay put for at least three years. However if you might update to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best option.</p>
