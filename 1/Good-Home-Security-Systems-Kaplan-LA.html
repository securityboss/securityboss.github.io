<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
<p>Adding an exterior video camera provides you a lot more control over your home's security. The motion detection feature starts taping the instant someone approaches your doorstep and sends you an alert. You can monitor the live action right on your computer, tablet or mobile phone. Here at Fort Knox ® Security Systems, we provide an unequaled mix of service and cost on all our home security cameras. One fast telephone call to one of our educated technicians and you'll comprehend why we stand out among our competitors as the prominent Houston video surveillance company and alarm monitoring provider in Texas.</p>
