<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
