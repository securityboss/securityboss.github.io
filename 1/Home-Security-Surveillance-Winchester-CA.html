<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Property protection gadgets are designed to safeguard particular, concrete properties, such as precious jewelry, paintings, money boxes, and household heirlooms. These gadgets can be outfitted with anti-tampering technology to avoid being deactivated. If the product to which the gadget has been attached is moved or interrupted, the sensor will activate an alarm.</p>

Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the price and it doesn't eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
