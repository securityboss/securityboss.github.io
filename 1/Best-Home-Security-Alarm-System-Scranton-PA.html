<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect sense of security considering that it avoids only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
