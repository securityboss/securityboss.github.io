<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the exact same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical existing to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
