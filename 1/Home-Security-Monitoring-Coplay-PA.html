<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely regular because the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as customers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
