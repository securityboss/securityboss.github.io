<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security specialists investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. The smart bit is that the camera not just finds that individuals have entered its 130-degree visual field, but it will also have a stab at recognising them too. Possibly more usefully, if somebody passes who the camera does not know, you get an alert about an "unidentified face". You can inform the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it ought to automatically understand.</p>
<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are relatively common. If a house owner forgets their keys and returns within with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensor is activated by a neighborhood cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company every time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. Incorrect alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a homeowner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>
<h2>Wireless Camera Systems Overview Carrizo Springs</h2>

Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range.
