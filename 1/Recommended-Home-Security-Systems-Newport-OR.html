We first noticed Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a staff (and friends and family) fave. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out alerts, you can't manage it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

If you live in a large house with several rooms and floors, then you must get a self monitored alarm that can set up special alert zones. </p>
