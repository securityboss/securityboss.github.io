<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when consumers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
<p>Scout Alarm ties with Ring for the most economical monitoring strategy starting at $10.

This additional cost isn't ideal, however when compared to the Frontpoint and Vivint $40-and $45- particular minimum prices per month for monitoring, Scout Alarm is a steal. </p>
