<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company. When the system identifies a break-in, fire, or other emergency, it alerts the security team and, sometimes, emergency situation responders.

We likewise discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also provide a broader range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
