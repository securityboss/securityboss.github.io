<p>For these different systems to assemble or to integrate them together into a single user interface, a detailed knowledge of all the needed systems is needed. There are just two alternatives if there are no as-built documents supplying performance and configuration information to make this integration work.

The other approach is to rip and replace, carrying out a total upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>

Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a broader series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
