<p>Any outdoor camera worth its salt must be able to withstand exposure to the components and should bring an IP (Ingress Protection) rating IP ratings include 2 digits that tell you just how well the camera will hold up under the majority of weather conditions. The first digit following the IP prefix tells you how resistant the camera is to the ingress of solid items such as wind-blown dust and varies from 0 (no protection) to 6 (overall protection against dust and dirt). The second number informs you how resistant the camera is to moisture and varies from 0 (no protection) to 9 (safeguarded versus close range, high pressure spray downs from all angles).</p>

These companies designed their equipment in this manner to make customers stick with them longer, because switching monitoring companies means hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for consumers.
