<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that give access to a home's security app to approximately 20 family members. Nevertheless, shared monitoring isn't a feature offered from all companies.

In addition, officers responding to these false alarms are unable to respond to actual emergency situations or conduct preventative patrols.</p>
