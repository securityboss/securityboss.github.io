<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. The creative bit is that the camera not just spots that people have actually entered its 130-degree field of vision, however it will also have a stab at identifying them too.
