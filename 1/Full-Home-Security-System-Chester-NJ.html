<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can determine people the camera is identifying using face recognition.

We likewise found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise provide a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
