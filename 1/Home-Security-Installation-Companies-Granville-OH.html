<p>Surveillance systems present law enforcement "bad apples" with an appealing chance for criminal misuse. In 1997, for instance, a top-ranking police official in Washington, DC was caught utilizing police databases to collect details on clients of a gay club.

<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive assailant, considering that the disturbance of the network avoids the flow of information and actually indirectly safeguards data by preventing it from being transferred. The typical reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, supplying a chance for the destructive assaulter to tape these codes and utilize different breaking tools to analyze security weak points and exploit them to gain unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can release a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based upon the "design" security key caught during the network recovery.</p>
