<p>After checking dozens of wired and wireless options, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2.

Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there.

<p>Unlike conventional alarm systems, which have a control board (typically located in the entrance hall) that is used to deactivate the alarm and arm and alert you if any sensing units have been activated, smart alarms are managed from a smartphone app. The app lets you arm and deactivate the alarm, even if you've currently left home, and notifies you if any of the sensing units have been triggered, instead of getting home to discover your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and potentially annoying your neighbours). Nevertheless, smart alarms do need a center that permits the different elements to wirelessly connect. However for the majority of smart alarms this hub can be put throughout your home.</p>
