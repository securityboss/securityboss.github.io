It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
