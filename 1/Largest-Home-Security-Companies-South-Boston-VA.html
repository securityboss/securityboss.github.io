Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly charge (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>

It can be awkward and slow to utilize on celebration - with the process of connecting to the camera for a live view rather sluggish at times. The previous, cheaper variation of the outdoor Nest web cam is still on sale too if you wish to conserve some cash - it does have a cable connected however, rather than working wirelessly, which means it's a bit simpler to screw up for prospective intruders.
