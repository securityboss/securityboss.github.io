<p>With state-of-the-art burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have taping storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and general motion. We believe that's expensive.</p>

<h3>The Best Security System For Your Home in Jenkintown PA</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>
