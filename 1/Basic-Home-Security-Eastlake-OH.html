With standard smart home devices like automated door locks, you can remain in bed and check that you locked your doors.

<p>Surveillance systems present law enforcement "bad apples" with a tempting opportunity for criminal abuse.

It will record clips when it views movement (and a few seconds before so you get the full view of what occurred) and you can view these for a week before they're erased. You can extend the amount of days you get by acquiring a membership, but I do not think many people will require that option.</p>
