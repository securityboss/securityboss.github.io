<p>Models: There are a number of various kinds of security cameras out there. Some of the more common ones are bullet cameras, which are the rectangular boxes you might see extending from a wall; dome cameras, which are frequently attached to a ceiling and housed in a tinted cover; and pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras, which provide remote-control capabilities to adjust the field of vision.

<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the exact same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electric present. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
