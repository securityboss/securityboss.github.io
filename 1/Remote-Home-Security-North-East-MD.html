<p>Hello Claudine, can you access this dome security camera or not? If yes, you may access this camera by means of your mobile phone or PC and check out whether your camera is working. If not, you may have a look at the dome camera at night and see if there is any red glow given off by the infrared lights ringed around the lens. If yes, then the dome camera is working. Hope this assists.</p>
<p>There's a few other cool features in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving things if it finds an intruder; a convenient intercom function that permits the device to function as a wise doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll require the Nest Hey there doorbell ); and, since Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.</p>
