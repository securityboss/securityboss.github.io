<h2>Caught On Video With Surveillance Cameras Waltham</h2>
<p>I have this camera linked to my home computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able place the camera around 10 feet away from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without trouble. The IR lights at night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the cost and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were impressive in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a large, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based upon offered bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest consists of the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
