<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely regular given that the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers realize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
