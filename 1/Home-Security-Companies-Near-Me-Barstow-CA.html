<p>The Hive View provides excellent 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation activated too easily, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting. Because this camera has no native geofencing features, you have to manually stop notifications (and recording, because it does that even when alerts are off).

We love that the system includes a wifi security camera and only notifies you when motion is developed by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false informs). However, you do require to register for the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 each month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensing units have been activated.

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of totally free cloud storage, and it captures a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors.
