As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers recognize that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
