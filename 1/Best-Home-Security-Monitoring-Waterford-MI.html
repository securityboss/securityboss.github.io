<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and space seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when consumers realize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, however it suggests you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will respond.
