<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.

<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All objects give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy produced by an object is called its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it releases.

And while this is a pretty basic function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is relatively unusual in outdoor security cameras.</p>
