<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, a lot of alarm systems work the exact same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical current. When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
