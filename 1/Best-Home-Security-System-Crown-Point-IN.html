<p>Another factor to consider with wireless home security systems is the limited series of sensing units. The majority of radio frequencies are weak outside a series of 500 feet. This suggests that you need to structure your wireless system with this in mind, specifically if your property is larger than 4,500 square feet. When seeking to buy a surveillance camera, there are a few aspects to consider.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens.

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
