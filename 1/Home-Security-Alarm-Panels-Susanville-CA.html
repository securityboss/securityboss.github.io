Again the sales people, or a minimum of mine, do not discuss the 3 year commitment. I called their customer care team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to discuss it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, since apparently they vehicle renew you at some point unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a written not by mail.

When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
