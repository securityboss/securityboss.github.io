<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be expensive but is necessary.

Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera detected activity. Being able to compare a person and a vehicle, for instance, enables you to reduce unneeded notifies.
