<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal considering that the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers realize that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's normally too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

Hardwired systems need minimal maintenance, and except a basic power blackout, are more difficult to disrupt. Despite a basic improvement in wireless technology, there appear to be less ways for hardwired systems to be interfered with and immobilized. </p>
