<p>The arguments for and versus CCTV cameras listed below are simply examples of comments that have actually been debated, and are not designed to reproduce views from IFSEC Global and its group. Following behind the Ultra 4K is the brand new Arlo Pro 3, which provides a comparable plan however with 2K video instead.

<h3>Security Alarm Monitoring in Thousand Oaks CA</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
