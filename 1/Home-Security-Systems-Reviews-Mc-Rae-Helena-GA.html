<h2>Monitored Alarms Before Signing Up To That Expensive Monitoring Contract Mc Rae Helena</h2>
<p>I have this camera attached to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cord, I was able place the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to find the camera without trouble. The IR lights in the evening are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the rate and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
