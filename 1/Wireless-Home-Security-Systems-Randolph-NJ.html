If you prepare to match the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first check out the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we don't believe that these problems change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our current suggestion.</p>
