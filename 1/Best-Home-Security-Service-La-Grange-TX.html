Since they have bigger internal video sensing units and higher-quality components that can adjust and capture outstanding low light video, commercial cameras exceed their more affordable cousins.</p>

Since this camera has no native geofencing functions, you need to manually stop notices (and recording, since it does that even when notices are off). We likewise experienced above-average connection problems, with two Hive test systems disconnecting 8 times over 2 months.</p>
