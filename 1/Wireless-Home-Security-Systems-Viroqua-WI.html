<p>There are 2 main kinds of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: internet procedure (IP) cameras and the conventional analog cameras.

<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its understated looks and face recognition software application. The latter allows you to see specifically when a specific person arrives at the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. However Netatmo has actually broadened its security variety with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof doors and window sensors referred to as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to introduce a clever smoke alarm and siren later on this year, that makes this an even better proposal.</p>
<p>In addition, IP cameras work with network video recorders (NVRs), which use a number of other advantages over the older digital video recorders (DVRs) that this guide will cover. In other words, NVR records higher-quality video and enables systems to be scaled up much more quickly than can be finished with DVR.
