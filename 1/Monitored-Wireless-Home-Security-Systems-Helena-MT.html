<p>With advanced alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
