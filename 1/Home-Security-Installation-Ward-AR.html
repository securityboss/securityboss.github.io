<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers realize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
