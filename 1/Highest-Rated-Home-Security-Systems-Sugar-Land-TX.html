<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can determine people the camera is finding utilizing face acknowledgment. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to identify those people and will send mobile phone signals with that details when they appear at your home.

We likewise found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a wider variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
