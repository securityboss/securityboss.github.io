<h2>CCTV Camera Types You Should Know Before Purchase Alma</h2>

<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the photo quality based on offered bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest includes the alternative to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that might defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
