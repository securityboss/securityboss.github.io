If your motion sensing unit is triggered, you get an alert in your smartphone app. There's no latency so you get informed instantly so you can take instant actions such as triggering a loud alarm, contacting the authorities, or using the camera's two-way audio system to talk with the potential trespassers.</p>

ADT uses an independent distributor design including third-party dealers. The dealers determine which equipment to use.</p>
