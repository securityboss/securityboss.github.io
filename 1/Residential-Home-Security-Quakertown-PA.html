<p>A system that requires an agreement may be a smart option for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to spend for the equipment up-front. Why?

We've seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our choice: No agreement.</p>
