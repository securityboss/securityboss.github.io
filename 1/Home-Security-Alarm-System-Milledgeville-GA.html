For even more basic smarts, it's fantastic, though. If you don't already have an Arlo camera or 2 in place, you're going to need to install a hub that's wired to your router, so bear that in mind - the cameras all connect to the hub (not to your Wi-Fi), and this can suggest there are range issues.</p>

<p>The Blink XT2 is small, operates on two AA batteries, and consists of a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it captures a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notices and live views were painfully slow, and the range is bad.
