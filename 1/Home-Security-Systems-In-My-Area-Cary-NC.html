<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare individuals and general motion. We think that's costly.</p>
