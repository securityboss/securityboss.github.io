<p>We've long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed appearances and face acknowledgment software. The latter allows you to see specifically when a particular person reaches your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. However Netatmo has broadened its security range with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof doors and window sensing units called Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to introduce a smart smoke detector and siren later this year, which makes this an even better proposal.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it spots an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send smart device signals with that info when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise provide a wider series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
