<p>Blue cameras are compatible with Alexa and IFTTT only. Apple HomeKit compatibility coming quickly to all Blue cameras. For too long, the wise home hasn't been really clever.

<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 each month, but you'll pay a little bit more if you wish to include additional functions, like a security camera.

Vivint has no minimum contract requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
<p>Some Ring users have reported security breaches in their devices that enable bad actors to use the two-way interaction and view the video feed. In a statement to SafeWise, Ring noted that these breaches can be avoided by using strong, unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, altering passwords routinely, and including licensed users instead of sharing credentials. </p>
