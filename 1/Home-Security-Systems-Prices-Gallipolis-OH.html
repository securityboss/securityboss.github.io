<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
