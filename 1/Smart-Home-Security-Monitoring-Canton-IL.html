<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>

<p>While you have to spend for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it's one of the more economical subscriptions out there at $2.99 a month.
