We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and general motion.
