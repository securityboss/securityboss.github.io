<p>We have actually been very pleased with the system, the people who represent the company and the security in which it brings to our shops. The CCTV program also enables us to view the stores & pastry shop facility within one application, which has been a terrific function of the program.

<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it counts on a wireless signal, meaning that storms and strong winds have the power to interrupt the system and could even trigger false alarms. False alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they could result in fines from the provider or the police if they happen regularly enough. Another possible drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be changed or charged routinely in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more expensive than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is generally offset by the fact that there are no installation expenses.</p>
<p>So why do not we rank ADT greater? In some ways, ADT frustrates us. We see so many growing companies branching out and trying new things in the home security space. However ADT isn't maintaining. It costs a lot, its pricing isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long agreements. Not to point out that the customer support experience differs commonly depending on the dealer you choose. </p>
