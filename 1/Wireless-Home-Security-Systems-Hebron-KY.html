The technology gradually developed into the extremely advanced yet cost effective systems offered today. The first uses of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the ways to tape-record video and watch it later on.

<p>A single monitor in the parking lot management office was linked to the output for monitoring cameras. The PCU provided shuffling of each camera feed and choose intervals and a keyboard to input the call number for each camera, or the capability to scroll through each camera one by one.

<p>Consider it by doing this, if a decent still-camera costs a minimum of two hundred and fifty dollars (United States $), how can a more sophisticated camera be cost the low rate of forty dollars? It simply does not accumulate. To use such low prices, producers must cut corners, and the end result is compromised performance.
