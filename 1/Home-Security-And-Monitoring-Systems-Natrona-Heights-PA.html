<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the exact same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually installed on the deck by a licensed electrician (who happens to be my partner). All of the cameras were connected to the exact same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside (approximately 40 feet from the cameras); service to your home was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face informs, which can determine individuals the camera is identifying utilizing face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those people and will send smart device notifies with that information when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also offer a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
