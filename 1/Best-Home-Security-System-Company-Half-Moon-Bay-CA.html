<p>Carbon monoxide gas detection. Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is a gas that can be toxic to both human beings and animals.

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect sense of security considering that it prevents only "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
