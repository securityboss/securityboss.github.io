<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>

It can be uncomfortable and slow to use on celebration - with the process of connecting to the camera for a live view rather languid at times. The previous, more affordable version of the outdoor Nest cam is still on sale too if you wish to save some cash - it does have a cable attached though, instead of working wirelessly, which suggests it's a bit much easier to screw up for potential burglars. Definitely among the very best security cameras in 2020.</p>
