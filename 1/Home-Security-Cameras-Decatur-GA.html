Modern systems now have sensational capabilities", though these have actually developed reasonable misgivings about the risk for privacy and possible abuse such abilities produce.

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not especially revolutionary, so we're really recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan option.

So pick what will be the better offer for you. Go with the agreement and enjoy those cost savings if you understand you'll remain put for at least 3 years. But if you might update to a new office with various security needs, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
