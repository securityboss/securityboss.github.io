<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see in the evening. If catching video in the dark is a priority, make certain your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
