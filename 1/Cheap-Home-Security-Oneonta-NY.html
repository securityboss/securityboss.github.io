<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>

<p>You can trigger the 80dB alarm if you do come across a home invasion emergency situation. I am slightly disappointed by the loudness of the alarm. At 80dB, it has to do with as loud as a food mill whereas lots of other alarm are as loud as 90dB or even 105dB. Despite that, the alarm should be enough to scare away burglars for the most part. To recoup costs and hold alarm companies liable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company should be licensed, pay any registration or incorrect alarm costs, and provide physical evidence like camera footage or a damaged window to call for police reaction.</p>
