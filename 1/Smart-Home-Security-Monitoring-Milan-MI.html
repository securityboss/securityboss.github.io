<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to leave the contract you need to pay 75% of the contract.  So I still have 21 months of a contract I had no idea I remained in, to get out I have to pay $783.  Truly annoying. Once again the sales individuals, or a minimum of mine, do not point out the 3 year dedication. I called their client service team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not have to mention it, it's on you to check out the fine print. I'm paying the lump amount, due to the fact that apparently they auto renew you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a composed not by mail.  ADT is a headache, way too expensive, and not fantastic.</p>
<p>As the name recommends, this alarm is a starter kit". So it's pretty much expected that it won't have actually extended customizability or a wide variety of functions.

When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the threat and, if needed, could simply push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
