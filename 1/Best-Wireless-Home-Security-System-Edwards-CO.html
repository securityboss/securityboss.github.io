<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>

And if you want to conserve 4K videos, it's an extra $1.99 per camera monthly, on top of the monthly plan, the latter of which is waived for the first year.
