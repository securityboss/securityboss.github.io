<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching.

If you're not mechanically inclined, having an expert established the system might give you more self-confidence than if you did the work yourself. Wireless cameras can't have all of it-- watch things inside by day, and watch on what's going on outside after dark. It hardly ever works.</p>
